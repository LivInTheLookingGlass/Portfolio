  Olivia is an extremely kind and thoughtful colleague. I consider myself fortunate to have met such wonderful
  colleagues, but what truly sets her apart is her passion for tech. Not only is she technically extremely strong, but
  she keeps herself extremely up to date with advances in software and so on. She has been invaluable to our team with
  her skills in automation, testing, and has greatly increased the average quality of code in our tech stack. She has
  an extremely strong understanding of how computers work and has a strong body of work, both in her professional
  career and open source contributions, both of which I can vouch for. I would highly recommend hiring Olivia as a
  software engineer!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  I worked with Olivia for about two years at Intel, where she started as an undergraduate intern in the Non-Volatile
  Memory System Division. Known for her coding expertise and attention to detail, Olivia excelled in previous
  internships. My role involved debugging storage protocol issues in SSDs for the Client market.
  
  Olivia joined me on a challenging project to validate a new feature before it was fully architected. She analyzed
  existing specifications and our initial implementations, documenting changes and overseeing the implementation. She
  was instrumental in defining and executing test cases, collecting data, and analyzing results. Olivia determined the
  root causes of failing tests and collaborated with firmware and engineering teams to implement fixes.
  
  Olivia demonstrated intelligence and aptitude beyond that of an average intern, effectively following instructions
  and working independently. After her internship, she accepted a full-time position and continued to impress with her
  performance, surpassing some experienced engineers.
  
  In my opinion, Olivia will be an outstanding member of any team. Please contact me with any questions about our work
  together.
